The application writes to an SMB file share and creates a copy on a second file share. Both file shares are in the data center. The application uses two types of files: metadata files and image files. The company wants to store the copy on AWS. The company needs the ability to use SMB to access the data from either the data center or AWS if a disaster occurs. The copy of the data is rarely accessed but must be available within 5 minutes.",

    "question": "A company has a web application that uses Amazon API Gateway. AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. A recent marketing campaign has increased demand. Monitoring software reports that many requests have significantly longer response times than before the marketing campaign. A solutions architect enabled Amazon CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway and noticed that errors are occurring on 20% of the requests. In CloudWatch, the Lambda function Throttles metric represents 1% of the requests and the Errors metric represents 10% of the requests. Application logs indicate that, when errors occur, there is a call to DynamoDB. What change should the solutions architect make to improve the current response times as the web application becomes more popular?",

    "question": "A company has implemented a new security requirement. According to the new requirement, the company must scan all traffic from corporate AWS instances in the company's VPC for violations of the company's security policies. As a result of these scans, the company can block access to and from specific IP addresses. To meet the new requirement, the company deploys a set of Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets to serve as transparent proxies. The company installs approved proxy server software on these EC2 instances. The company modifies the route tables on all subnets to use the corresponding EC2 instances with proxy software as the default route. The company also creates security groups that are compliant with the security policies and assigns these security groups to the EC2 instances. Despite these configurations, the traffic of the EC2 instances in their private subnets is not being properly forwarded to the internet. What should a solutions architect do to resolve this issue?",

The company uses an Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. Amazon Route 53 is used to host all public zones. After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) error. The root cause is malformed HTTP headers that are returned to the ALB. The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage immediately after the error occurs. While the company is working on the problem, the solutions architect needs to provide a custom error page instead of the standard ALB error page to visitors. Which combination of steps will meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? (Choose two.)",

These maintenance tasks, which include updates and patches to the application servers, cause downtime.

The company has implemented an account structure in which each business unit has its own AWS account.

Each business unit can have access to only its own cost and utilization data. The IAM policies that govern the ability to set up AWS Cost and Usage Reports are in place.
