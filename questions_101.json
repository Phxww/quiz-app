The sales team stores petabytes of data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The marketing team uses Amazon QuickSight for data visualizations. The marketing team needs access to data that the sates team stores in the S3 bucket. The company has encrypted the S3 bucket with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. The marketing team has already created the IAM service role for QuickSight to provide QuickSight access in the marketing AWS account. The company needs a solution that will provide secure access to the data in the S3 bucket across AWS accounts. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",

The company uses a third-party security tool to monitor the inbound traffic to the application. The company has used the security tool for the last 15 years, and the tool has no cloud solutions available from its vendor. The company's security team is concerned about how to integrate the security tool with AWS technology. The company plans to deploy the application migration to AWS on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances will run in an Auto Scaling group in a dedicated VPC. The company needs to use the security tool to inspect all packets that come in and out of the VPC. This inspection must occur in real time and must not affect the application's performance. A solutions architect must design a target architecture on AWS that is highly available within an AWS Region. Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",

The image can run in as many containers as required to generate the route map. The company has divided the delivery area into sections with supply hubs so that delivery drivers travel the shortest distance possible from the hubs to the customers. To reduce the time necessary to generate route maps, each section uses its own set of Docker containers with a custom configuration that processes orders only in the section's area. The company needs the ability to allocate resources cost-effectively based on the number of running containers. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",

The creative team uses an Amazon S3 bucket in its AWS account to securely store images and media files that are used as content for the company’s marketing campaigns.

A solutions architect has created an IAM role that is named strategy_reviewer in the Strategy account. The solutions architect also has set up a custom AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key in the Creative account and has associated the key with the S3 bucket. However, when users from the Strategy account assume the IAM role and try to access objects in the S3 bucket, they receive an Access Denied error. The solutions architect must ensure that users in the Strategy account can access the S3 bucket. The solution must provide these users with only the minimum permissions that they need.

The research and development teams are running into capacity issues and have decided to re-architect their genomics analysis platform on AWS to scale based on workload demands and reduce the turnaround time from weeks to days. The company has a high-speed AWS Direct Connect connection. Sequencers will generate around 200 GB of data for each genome, and individual jobs can take several hours to process the data with ideal compute capacity. The end result will be stored in Amazon S3.

        "question": "An international delivery company hosts a delivery management system on AWS. Drivers use the system to upload confirmation of delivery. Confirmation includes the recipient’s signature or a photo of the package with the recipient. The driver’s handheld device uploads signatures and photos through FTP to a single Amazon EC2 instance. Each handheld device saves a file in a directory based on the signed-in user, and the file name matches the delivery number. The EC2 instance then adds metadata to the file after querying a central database to pull delivery information. The file is then placed in Amazon S3 for archiving. As the company expands, drivers report that the system is rejecting connections. The FTP server is having problems because of dropped connections and memory issues in response to these problems, a system engineer schedules a cron task to reboot the EC2 instance every 30 minutes. The billing team reports that files are not always in the archive and that the central system is not always updated. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that maximizes scalability to ensure that the archive always receives the files and that systems are always updated. The handheld devices cannot be modified, so the company cannot deploy a new application. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
