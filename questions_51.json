The script ingests files from an Amazon S3 bucket and processes the files. On average, the script takes approximately 5 minutes to process each file The script will not reprocess a file that the script has already processed. The company reviewed Amazon CloudWatch metrics and noticed that the EC2 instance is idle for approximately 40% of the time because of the file processing speed. The company wants to make the workload highly available and scalable. The company also wants to reduce long-term management overhead.

A database stores user metadata and references to files that are stored in Amazon S3. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. When forms are uploaded, the application sends notifications to a team through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). A team member then logs in and processes each form. The team member performs data validation on the form and extracts relevant data before entering the information into another system that uses an API. A solutions architect needs to automate the manual processing of the forms. The solution must provide accurate form extraction. minimize time to market, and minimize tong-term operational overhead.
