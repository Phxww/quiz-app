The company processes the data in 5-minute intervals. The company then copies vehicle telematics data to on-premises storage. Custom applications analyze this data to detect anomalies. The number of vehicles that send data grows constantly. Newer vehicles generate high volumes of data. The on-premises storage solution is not able to scale for peak traffic, which results in data loss. The company must modernize the solution and migrate the solution to AWS to resolve the scaling challenges. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
