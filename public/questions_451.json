    "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations. The company runs two firewall appliances in a centralized networking account. Each firewall appliance runs on a manually configured highly available Amazon EC2 instance. A transit gateway connects the VPC from the centralized networking account to VPCs of member accounts. Each firewall appliance uses a static private IP address that is then used to route traffic from the member accounts to the internet. During a recent incident, a badly configured script initiated the termination of both firewall appliances. During the rebuild of the firewall appliances, the company wrote a new script to configure the firewall appliances at startup. The company wants to modernize the deployment of the firewall appliances. The firewall appliances need the ability to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic when the network expands. The company must continue to use the firewall appliances to comply with company policy. The provider of the firewall appliances has confirmed that the latest version of the firewall code will work with all AWS services. Which combination of steps should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose three.)",

The frontend is served by an Apache web server, the middle tier is a monolithic Java application, and the storage tier is a PostgreSQL database. During a recent marketing promotion, customers could not place orders through the application because the application crashed. An analysis showed that all three tiers were overloaded. The application became unresponsive, and the database reached its capacity limit because of read operations. The company already has several similar promotions scheduled in the near future. A solutions architect must develop a plan for migration to AWS to resolve these issues.

    "question": "A company is using AWS CloudFormation as its deployment tool for all applications. It stages all application binaries and templates within Amazon S3 buckets with versioning enabled. Developers have access to an Amazon EC2 instance that hosts the integrated development environment (IDE). The developers download the application binaries from Amazon S3 to the EC2 instance, make changes, and upload the binaries to an S3 bucket after running the unit tests locally. The developers want to improve the existing deployment mechanism and implement CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline. The developers have the following requirements: • Use AWS CodeCommit for source control. • Automate unit testing and security scanning. • Alert the developers when unit tests fail. • Turn application features on and off, and customize deployment dynamically as part of CI/CD. • Have the lead developer provide approval before deploying an application.

    "question": "A company runs an ecommerce web application on AWS. The web application is hosted as a static website on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront for content delivery. An Amazon API Gateway API invokes AWS Lambda functions to handle user requests and order processing for the web application The Lambda functions store data in an Amazon ROS for MySQL DB cluster that uses On-Demand instances. The DB cluster usage has been consistent in the past 12 months. Recently, the website has experienced SQL injection and web exploit attempts. Customers also report that order processing time has increased during periods of peak usage. During these periods, the Lambda functions often have cold starts. As the company grows, the company needs to ensure scalability and low-latency access during traffic peaks. The company also must optimize the database costs and add protection against the SQL injection and web exploit attempts. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
