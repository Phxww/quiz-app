    "question": "A company is migrating an application from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. During migration design meetings, the company expressed concerns about the availability and recovery options for its legacy Windows file server. The file server contains sensitive business-critical data that cannot be recreated in the event of data corruption or data loss. According to compliance requirements, the data must not travel across the public internet. The company wants to move to AWS managed services where possible. The company decides to store the data in an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A solutions architect must design a solution that copies the data to another AWS Region for disaster recovery (DR) purposes. Which solution will meet these requirements?",

    "question": "A company owns a chain of travel agencies and is running an application in the AWS Cloud. Company employees use the application to search for information about travel destinations. Destination content is updated four times each year. Two fixed Amazon EC2 instances serve the application. The company uses an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone with a multivalue record of travel.example.com that returns the Elastic IP addresses for the EC2 instances. The application uses Amazon DynamoDB as its primary data store. The company uses a self-hosted Redis instance as a caching solution. During content updates, the load on the EC2 instances and the caching solution increases drastically. This increased load has led to downtime on several occasions. A solutions architect must update the application so that the application is highly available and can handle the load that is generated by the content updates.
