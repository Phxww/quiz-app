One hundred scientists are using this object storage to store their work-related documents. Each scientist has a personal folder on the object store. All the scientists are members of a single IAM user group. The research center's compliance officer is worried that scientists will be able to access each other's work. The research center has a strict obligation to report on which scientist accesses which documents. The team that is responsible for these reports has little AWS experience and wants a ready-to-use solution that minimizes operational overhead.

The business logic is exposed using a REST API with multiple functions. Player session data is stored in central file storage. Backend services use different API keys for throttling and to distinguish between live and test traffic. The load on the game backend varies throughout the day. During peak hours, the server capacity is not sufficient. There are also latency issues when fetching player session data. Management has asked a solutions architect to present a cloud architecture that can handle the game’s varying load and provide low-latency data access. The API model should not be changed.

The SageMaker instances are deployed in a VPC that does not have access to or from the internet. Datasets for ML model training are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Interface VPC endpoints provide access to Amazon S3 and the SageMaker APIs. Occasionally, the data scientists require access to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository to update Python packages that they use as part of their workflow. A solutions architect must provide access to the PyPI repository while ensuring that the SageMaker instances remain isolated from the internet. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
