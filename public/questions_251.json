Analysis of the CloudWatch metrics from the launch period showed consumption at about one quarter of the CPU and memory that the company expected. Initial demand for the game has subsided and has become more variable.

The company wants to resolve these challenges by migrating the application to AWS. Users from across the United States and Canada access the application. Only authenticated users should have the ability to access the application to upload files. The company will consider a solution that refactors the application, and the company needs to accelerate application development.

The website uses Amazon S3 for hosting and uses Amazon CloudFront as the content delivery network with AWS WAF configured. When the registration form is submitted, the website calls an Amazon API Gateway API endpoint that invokes an AWS Lambda function to process the payload and forward the payload to an external API call. During testing, a solutions architect encounters a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) error. The solutions architect confirms that the CloudFront distribution origin has the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to www.example.com.

The applications are a mix of Java and Node.js spread across different instance clusters. The company wants to minimize costs while standardizing by using a single deployment methodology. Most of the applications are part of month-end processing routines with a small number of concurrent users, but they are occasionally run at other times. Average application memory consumption is less than 1 GB. though some applications use as much as 2.5 GB of memory during peak processing. The most important application in the group is a billing report written in Java that accesses multiple data sources and often runs for several hours. Which is the MOST cost-effective solution?",

Developers can configure VPCs and launch Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. The EC2 instances retrieve approximately 1 TB of data each day from Amazon S3. The developer activity leads to excessive monthly data-transfer charges and NAT gateway processing charges between EC2 instances and S3 buckets, along with high compute costs. The company wants to proactively enforce approved architectural patterns for any EC2 instance and VPC infrastructure that developers deploy within the AWS accounts.

The company needs to increase visibility into details of AWS Billing and Cost Management. There are various accounts associated with AWS Organizations, including many development and production accounts. There is no consistent tagging strategy across the organization, but there are guidelines in place that require all infrastructure to be deployed using AWS CloudFormation with consistent tagging. Management requires cost center numbers and project ID numbers for all existing and future DynamoDB tables and RDS instances. Which strategy should the solutions architect provide to meet these requirements?",

The statistical analysis is not critical to the business, and data points are processed during the next iteration if a particular run fails. The current architecture uses a pool of Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances with 1-year reservations. These EC2 instances run full time to ingest and store the streaming data in attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. A scheduled script launches EC2 On-Demand Instances each night to perform the nightly processing. The instances access the stored data from NFS shares on the ingestion servers. The script terminates the instances when the processing is complete. The Reserved Instance reservations are expiring. The company needs to determine whether to purchase new reservations or implement a new design. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",

The estate consists of a mixture of physical machines and VMs. One application that the company will migrate has many dependencies that are sensitive to latency. The company is unsure what all the dependencies are. However the company knows that the low-latency communications use a custom IP-based protocol that runs on port 1000. The company wants to migrate the application and these dependencies together to move all the low-latency interfaces to AWS at the same time. The company has installed the AWS Application Discovery Agent and has been collecting data for several months. What should the company do to identify the dependencies that need to be migrated in the same phase as the application?",
