End users experience slow application performance during times of peak usage, when CPU utilization is consistently more than 95%. A user data script installs required custom packages on the EC2 instance. The process of launching the instance takes several minutes. The company is creating an Auto Scaling group that has mixed instance groups, varied CPUs, and a maximum capacity limit. The Auto Scaling group will use a launch template for various configuration options. The company needs to decrease application latency when new instances are launched during auto scaling.

The jobs take 120-600 seconds to finish running. • A web application that runs on a web server. End users use the web application to generate reports that are accessible to the general public.

    "question": "An events company runs a ticketing platform on AWS. The company’s customers configure and schedule their events on the platform. The events result in large increases of traffic to the platform. The company knows the date and time of each customer’s events. The company runs the platform on an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster. The ECS cluster consists of Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group uses a predictive scaling policy. The ECS cluster makes frequent requests to an Amazon S3 bucket to download ticket assets. The ECS cluster and the S3 bucket are in the same AWS Region and the same AWS account. Traffic between the ECS cluster and the S3 bucket flows across a NAT gateway. The company needs to optimize the cost of the platform without decreasing the platform's availability. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
