The application frontend is a static website that runs on two Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application backend is a Python application that runs on three EC2 instances behind another ALB. The EC2 instances are large, general purpose On-Demand Instances that were sized to meet the on-premises specifications for peak usage of the application. The application averages hundreds of thousands of requests each month. However, the application is used mainly during lunchtime and receives minimal traffic during the rest of the day. A solutions architect needs to optimize the infrastructure cost of the application without negatively affecting the application availability. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements?

    "question": "A company gives users the ability to upload images from a custom application. The upload process invokes an AWS Lambda function that processes and stores the image in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application invokes the Lambda function by using a specific function version ARN. The Lambda function accepts image processing parameters by using environment variables. The company often adjusts the environment variables of the Lambda function to achieve optimal image processing output. The company tests different parameters and publishes a new function version with the updated environment variables after validating results. This update process also requires frequent changes to the custom application to invoke the new function version ARN. These changes cause interruptions for users. A solutions architect needs to simplify this process to minimize disruption to users. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",

An application that is installed on an on-premises machine runs periodic jobs to aggregate and transform the telemetry and device metadata. The application creates reports that users view by using another web application that runs on the same on- premises machine. The periodic jobs take 120-600 seconds to run. However, the web application is always running. The company is moving the platform to AWS and must reduce the operational overhead of the stack.

The application uses a domain name setup in Amazon Route 53. Some users reported occasional issues when the users attempted to access the website during peak hours. An operations team found that the ALB sometimes returned HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors. The company wants to display a custom error message page when these errors occur.
