    "question": "A company uses an on-premises data analytics platform. The system is highly available in a fully redundant configuration across 12 servers in the company’s data center. The system runs scheduled jobs, both hourly and daily, in addition to one-time requests from users. Scheduled jobs can take between 20 minutes and 2 hours to finish running and have tight SLAs. The scheduled jobs account for 65% of the system usage. User jobs typically finish running in less than 5 minutes and have no SLA. The user jobs account for 35% of system usage. During system failures, scheduled jobs must continue to meet SLAs. However, user jobs can be delayed. A solutions architect needs to move the system to Amazon EC2 instances and adopt a consumption-based model to reduce costs with no long-term commitments. The solution must maintain high availability and must not affect the SLAs. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",

Mobile clients connect to the API by using a domain name that is hosted on Amazon Route 53. The company has created a Route 53 multivalue answer routing policy with the IP addresses of all the EC2 instances. Recently, the app has been overwhelmed by large and sudden increases to traffic. The app has not been able to keep up with the traffic. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution so that the app can handle the new and varying load. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",

Each Availability Zone contains one public subnet and one private subnet. The service runs on Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnets. An Application Load Balancer in the public subnets is in front of the service. The service needs to communicate with the internet and does so through two NAT gateways. The service uses Amazon S3 for image storage. The EC2 instances retrieve approximately 1 ТВ of data from an S3 bucket each day. The company has promoted the service as highly secure. A solutions architect must reduce cloud expenditures as much as possible without compromising the service’s security posture or increasing the time spent on ongoing operations.
